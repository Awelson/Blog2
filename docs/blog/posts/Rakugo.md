Rakugo (落語) is a form of Japanese verbal comedy where a lone storyteller kneels on a raised platform while telling a story (often comedic in nature) to a public audience[^1]. What I want to talk about today are twofold : One, the etymology behind rakugo, and two, how this relatively ancient form of entertainment has seeped its way into pop culture.

## Etymology

Rakugo is made up of the kanji 落 and 語, the latter meaning "word", "language", or "speech" and is hence self-explanatory. What is more interesting is the appearance of the kanji 落. It is commonly seen in the verb pair 落ちる・落とす, meaning "to drop". It is not immediately clear how "drop" could possibly be related to "comedic storytelling". In fact, when I first heard of the word "rakugo", I thought for sure that it would be written as 楽語, where the former kanji, 楽, means "happiness", "comfort", etc...

It turns out that 落ち (ochi), the noun form of the verbs 落ちる・落とす, can be translated as "punchline" in English. In other words, 楽語 literally means "story with a punchline". How "drop" and "punchline" are related, I don't know. I tried searching for sources that would explain this, but I couldn't find much beyond some blogs[^2] and forums[^3] which gave conflicting answers anyways. My idea is that "punchline" -> "outcome/conclusion" -> "drop", i.e. the punchline is where the story "drops" itself. Maybe it's not even correct to attempt rationalizing this from an English language perspective, but whatever.

## Pop Culture

### [Jugemu (寿限無)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugemu)

The most famous rakugo story in terms of its appearance in pop culture is probably Jugemu (寿限無). The comedic part of the story comes from the repetition of a character's (Jugemu's) ridiculously long full name : 

??? quote "Jugemu's full name :"

    Jugemu Jugemu (寿限無 寿限無)
    Gokō-no Surikire (五劫の擦り切れ)
    Kaijarisuigyo-no (海砂利水魚の)
    Suigyōmatsu Unraimatsu Fūraimatsu (水行末 雲来末 風来末)
    Kuunerutokoro-ni Sumutokoro (食う寝る処に住む処)
    Yaburakōji-no Burakōji (やぶら柑子のぶら柑子)
    Paipopaipo Paipo-no Shūringan (パイポパイポ パイポのシューリンガン)
    Shūringan-no Gūrindai (シューリンガンのグーリンダイ)
    Gūrindai-no Ponpokopī-no Ponpokonā-no (グーリンダイのポンポコピーのポンポコナーの)
    Chōkyūmei-no Chōsuke (長久命の長助)

Jugemu has been referenced numerous of times in modern media, most notably by the anime [Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5114/Fullmetal_Alchemist__Brotherhood) in their 4-koma theater :

Another appearance is as the ending song in the anime [Joshiraku](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12679/Joshiraku) :

which currently has over 56 million views. If you've got a keen eye then you'll notice as well that Joshi (女子) Raku (落) is an anime about girls doing rakugo (I swear there's an anime about anything these days). There is also a reference by [Gintama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_K9bn60A4g) and there have also been [memes/skits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThtvOjRnwmA) made based on Jugemu. If your Japanese is good enough, you may find [this parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8PxNJSOaqo) of Jugemu entertaining as well.

For this reason, Jugemu and its references in media are probably most people's (myself included) first introduction into the world of rakugo. Unfortunately, at the time I did not go so far as to look into this topic beyond "oh, so this is something Japanese people do" and so, for a long time afterwards I stopped thinking about rakugo... that is until I encountered, rather recently, another rakugo reference in media..

### [Shinigami (死神)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%BB%E7%A5%9E_(%E8%90%BD%E8%AA%9E))

Shinigami (死神) is another famous rakugo story. 死神 basically means "the God of death", which we probably know better by the name "Grim Reaper". You can hear the full story on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4PCds4tlT4) (English subtitles included). How I got to know shinigami is through the song by the same name by Kenshi Yonezu which is themed around the rakugo story :

I ended up listening to shinigami (the rakugo story) because I was interested in the phrase "Ajaraka mokuren tekerettsu no paa!"  that was used in the song. In the story, it turns out that this phrase is uttered (like a spell) to chase the shinigami away. Of course, I tried digging deeper and found a [nice blogpost](https://brahmus.seesaa.net/article/500043036.html) which explains how this phrase came about :

Apparently, this "spell" was added for comedic effects since there was concern with the story being too dark and not going over well with the audience[^4]. The "spell" however is not completely gibberish. The "mokuren" part is based on the name of one of Buddha's closest disciple, [Maudgalyāyana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maudgalyayana). In Japanese, the name is pronounced Mokuren/Mokukenren (目犍連). The "Ajaraka" part is based on the word "acharya" (阿闍梨) which is an honorific used for Buddhist high monks. The rest of the spell is probably gibberish; "Ajaraka mokuren tekerettsu no paa!" is basically calling on the spirit of Maudgalyāyana, then making some noises to scare the shinigami away.

Finally, I would just like to add that I am currently watching [Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28735/Shouwa_Genroku_Rakugo_Shinjuu) (another anime about rakugo) and I am enjoying it so far. The first episode is basically a freaking movie and I was happy to hear "Ajaraka mokuren tekerettsu no paa!" within the first minute and immediately understanding the reference.
