## What is a pillbug?

For those who do not know (because I sure as hell didn't), the ["pill bug"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillidiidae) is a common name given to the *Armadillidiidae* family of woodlice. The pill bug has the ability to roll into a ball, earning them the alternative (perhaps more familiar) name : roly-polies.

Despite now being aware of what a pillbug is, I'm sure that you guys are no closer to knowing what ***"The Pillbug Incident"*** could possibly be referring to, but I am going to need you guys to be a bit more patient as I talk about a seemingly unrelated topic.

## Weathernews LiVE

[Weathernews LiVE (WNL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weathernews_LiVE) is a private Japanese weather report channel which primarily broadcasts through the internet (as opposed to the television, because I know some of you guys forgot those exist). For example, they sometimes broadcast live and upload clips of their broadcasts on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcB7Cp_igLw). 

WNL is massively popular for simply being a weather report channel, some of their clips have garnered more than 10 million views. Part of the reason why is because WNL's weather reporters are almost exclusively cute, young, females. WNL understands that the audience are watching for the personalities behind the screen as opposed to the weather news itself, and they lean into this by organizing fan meetup events, selling merchandise, etc.. Basically, these weatherwomen are being seen and treated the same way as any other idol. Japanalysis made a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7QG9owYEUY) on this topic, criticizing the normalization of this type of culture. Fortunately, this hotbed of a topic is not something we'll be delving towards; although the context may be helpful. 

## The Pillbug Incident

One of the most famous WNL clips (over 18 million views at the time of writing) is the "ダンゴムシ事件" (pillbug incident), a blooper where the weather caster Rinon Ohshima (大島璃音) mistakenly refers to her colleague, the meteorologist Yamaguchi Takehisa (山口剛央), as a "pillbug", leading to a funny exchange :

The only reason I thought to write about this "incident" is because this blooper is a great way to learn about Japanese particles. Afterall, the cause of Ohshima's unfortunate blunder is the result of an incorrect particle usage. 

## Clip analysis

### Part 1 : The Context

<span class="clickable" onclick="playSegment(0,7.6)"> Click to play segment (0:00-0:07) </span>
```
大島 : 今日は結構気温東京上がりましたけどもダンゴムシはまだ今日は見当たらなかったですか？
山口 : 今日は出なかったです。
```

The conversation that will eventually lead to the infamous "Pillbug Incident". Ohshima started by asking Yamaguchi if he was able to find any pillbugs today despite it getting hotter (in Tokyo), to which Yamaguchi replied that he wasn't able to, and the conversation continued on from there.

To understand this bit of dialogue, you will need two pieces of context :


!!! note "Context 1"

    The appearance of pillbugs is known to correlate with different weather conditions. For example, pillbugs prefer to live in cool, dark, and moist environments[^1], so you are more likely to see them during or after it rains.

!!! note "Context 2"

    Yamaguchi is well known to be a data enthusiast, personally collecting all sorts of data ranging from insect activity to natural disasters[^2]. Ohshima asked if Yamaguchi was able to find any pillbugs today with this in mind. 

### Part 2 : The Incident

<span class="clickable" onclick="playSegment(8.3,13)"> Click to play segment (0:08-0:13) </span>
<div markdown="1">
<pre><code>大島 : さあ、ということでダンゴムシ<b>にも</b>ね、解説していただきましたけど。
</code></pre>
</div>


"Well, with that said, we've received an explanation from a pillbug as well...", said Ohshima, indirectly referring to Yamaguchi as a ダンゴムシ (pillbug in Japanese). Ohshima's blunder stems from mistakenly marking ダンゴムシ with the particle にも. 

In most cases, including this one, にも can be thought of as the particles に and も operating separately[^3]. That is to say, ダンゴムシ is marked twice, once by に and the second time by も. Marking an object with the particle も gives it a sense of "also", "another", "yet again", etc... For example :

```
「私もりんごが好き」: I too like apples 
「りんごもすき」: I like apples too
```

In the first case 私 (I/me) is marked by も. You are proclaiming yourself as an (additional) member of the "apple-liker" group. You would say this when your friends are talking about how much they love apples, and you want to include yourself as a part of that. In the second case りんご (apple) is marked. You are proclaiming that apples, perhaps in addition to bananas, mangos, etc... are also a member of the "fruits-I-like" group.

The particle に is more complex as it has many functions (7, according to the DOJG). In this specific instance に acts as :

!!! quote "From the Dictionary of Japanese Grammar (DOJG)[^4] : "

    "A particle that indicates an agent or a source in passive, causative, もらう/てまらう and other receiving constructions"

Isolating the key parts of Ohshima's sentence, we get

```
大島 : [ダンゴムシ] [にも] [解説して] [いただきました]
```

いただきました is the past tense of the verb いただく, which means "to recieve". You've probably heard the phrase いただきます being used before eating a meal. In the context of a meal this basically means : "I shall humbly receive/accept the food that is in front of me". 

!!! note

    いただく is no different to もらう apart from being more polite (it is the 謙譲語 of もらう)

A verb can be attached to いただく via its て-form to indicate the receival of an action. For example :

<div markdown="1">
`解説する (to explain) $\to$ 解説して + いただきました (received an explanation)`
</div>

As discussed, に marks the agent/source of the action (解説する) that is being received. Thus :

<div markdown="1">
`ダンゴムシに(も)解説していたきました : (also) received an explanation from a pillbug`
</div>

ダンゴムシ being marked with も indicates that the pillbug is part of a larger collection of things that you have received explanations from, or alternatively that the explanation from a pillbug is part of a larger series of events that happened. The second interpretation is probably more likely.

And so that concludes the explanation behind the grammatical mishap that took the attention of more than 18 million people, **the pillbug incident**.

### Part 3 : Wait? There's More?

What? You think we're done with learning about particles? We're just getting started. Yamaguchi was quick to correct Ohshima's mistake :

<span class="clickable" onclick="playSegment(13.5,18.5)"> Click to play segment (0:13-0:18) </span>
```
山口 : ダンゴムシ”の”ですよね？
大島 : あ、ダンゴムシ”の”。。。
山口 : 私、ダンゴムシではない。。。
```

"You probably meant to say 「ダンゴムシ**の**」 (instead of にも) right?", asked Yamaguchi, understandably in disbelief after having just been referred to as a pillbug lol. The の-corrected sentence is then :

```
ダンゴムシの解説していただきました
```

At first glance, it appears that we have a `Noun + の + Verb` pattern, which strays away from the typical `Noun + の + Noun` that we are used to. After searching around for a bit, I have found at least one case (probably the only case) in which this construction is possible : In attributive clauses, の marks the agent performing an action that serves as an attribute of something else[^5]. 

For example :

```
雪の降る夜 : A snowy night
カナエの作ったネックレス : The necklace that Kanae made
```

The pattern is : `Noun1 + の + Verb + Noun2`, where `Noun1` is the performer of `Verb` and this serves as an attribute for `Noun2`. However `ダンゴムシの解説していただきました` does not have a `Noun2`. Does this mean that the の-corrected sentence is ungrammatical? Surely Yamaguchi's correction to Ohshima's grammar mistake can't yet again be another grammar mistake?!

What we have overlooked is to understand that 解説する is a noun that has been "verbified" by the addition of する. That is to say 解説 is the noun "explanation" while 解説する is the verb "to explain". The idea is to treat「ダンゴムシの解説」as the noun "explanation about pillbugs" and observe that the addition of する turns it into the verb "to explain about pillbugs". 

Putting it all togther, ダンゴムシの解説していただきました means "(I) received an explanation about pillpugs" which was probably what Ohshima meant to say.

### Part 4 : Another Correction

<span class="clickable" onclick="playSegment(23,37)"> Click to play segment (0:23-0:37) </span>
```
大島 : 違う違う。山口さん、違いますよ。
   : 山口さん、ダンゴムシ"も"解説していただきましたけどって。
   : 言おうと思ったんですけども。私がちょっと色々間違えまして。
```


Ohshima reveals that she had intended to say 「ダンゴムシ**も**解説していただきました」 but a rougue "に" has slipped in by accident.

We've already mentioned that a も-marked object is given a sense of "also", "another", "in addition", etc... This means that we can interpret the intended sentence as : "Pillbugs (among other things), I received an explanation". 

With regards to how the rougue "に" slipped in, Ohshima was probably thinking about saying :

```
ダンゴムシ(について)も解説いただきました
```

Which can be interpreted as "**About** pillbugs (among other things), I received an explanation", 「について」 meaning "about", "with regards to", etc... Ohshima then probably forgot to say the ついて part of について.
